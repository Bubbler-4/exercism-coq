## Getting Started

For installation and learning resources, refer to the
[exercism help page](http://exercism.io/languages/coq).

## Checking the solution (testing everything)

To see if your solution works you just need to compile every file.

```bash
coqc *.v
```

There is no additional testing step needed as we can offload all testing to the type checker!

## Feedback, Issues, Pull Requests

The [exercism/xcoq](https://github.com/exercism/xcoq) repository on
GitHub is the home for all of the Coq exercises.

If you have feedback about an exercise, or want to help implementing a new
one, head over there and create an issue.  We'll do our best to help you!
